a is not changed after the method call since the value returned by increment_int_a is never stored anywhere.
Further more, we do not reassign the value of a to the value returned by the increment_int_a function, even
if it did return a string.

The value stored at the key location '32' is incremented in dictionary b as b is a dictionary with one key
'32' and an entry 0.
